## Note about usage of Typescript insead of Javascript

I've decided to use TypeScript in this project as part of the front-end implementation. TypeScript is a **superset of JavaScript**, meaning that every valid JavaScript program is also valid TypeScript. To effectively write TypeScript, a strong understanding of JavaScript is required, as the core language concepts, syntax, and functionality are shared.

My decision to use TypeScript is driven by two primary reasons:

- It works seamlessly with Next.js which I want to learn along with Typescript
- TypeScript adds static typing, improved tooling, and other modern features to JavaScript, which can enhance code maintainability and reduce runtime errors

"Your web application must utilize [...] JavaScript on the front-end."

This implementation does not deviate from the course requirements, as TypeScript is fundamentally JavaScript with additional features. All JavaScript code remains valid and operational within this framework.

## SkinLookup - introduction

I've been working with Rust skins for few years now, it's been my hobby.
I've made multiple tools for private use to calculate, aggregate and automate stuff related to Steam Market and Rust skins. I've always wanted to create something less technical and more graphical related to it, so using it would be not only be helpful but visually pleasing as well but I never had time for it.

This is the Final Project for Harvard's CS50W course - "Capstone".

This web application allows You to browse through Rust skins, add them to portfolio, show details about them, show historical price/volume charts and more.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

My project is completely different than the other projects in this course, it's form and implementation has almost nothing in common with any of previous applications.

SkinLookup is also much more complex than any of those projects. For first, it's tech stack is more sophisticated as it uses:

- **Next.js** as frontend framework _(beyond the scope of the course)_
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling _(beyond the scope of the course)_
- **Shadcn** for components and **Heroicons** for icons _(beyond the scope of the course)_
- **Django Rest Framework** as backend framework _(beyond the scope of the course)_
- **SQLite** as a database

Another thing worth noting is usage of **external API** - [SCMM](rust.scmm.app/docs/) to get up-to-date price history of every skin on site.

I'm also using skin preview images from Steam CDN (for example [this image](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2452862891801771581/B96690B4E46626858DF8FD93D59715427CE8267A/)). I've implemented several meaures to reduce load on those sites, especially SCMM since it's non-profit project maintained by good people.

This measures include:

- **Custom caching logic** on the backend for caching price data for adjustable period of time (ITEMDATA_EXPIRATION_HOURS)
  - This includes ItemData model
  - Automatic backend side data fetching - if cache has expired it fetched newest data automatically (and saves it)
  - Lazy loading - data is refreshed only when needed
  - Adjustable size of requested price history (lowered for development time - MAX_DAYS_PHSM)
- Using long **cache for images** (minimumCacheTTL) in Next.js config
- **Pagination** of site with all items, reducing amount of image requests
- Using fixed previously scraped item dataset which does include only subset of all (~4400) Rust items

Other features:

- Implemented **debouncer** for adding items in portfolio to reduce load on backend
- **Asynchronous** portfolio item data update on the backend side
- Implemented **short circuit mechanism** for searching to also reduce load on backend
  - Search bar is only displaying 10 results at a time so I keep other results that I've got from backend and try to filter those to get another 10 results. Only if I get less than that I send request to backend for more
- **Charts** with price history, volume history and summed up price history of group of items
- **Dynamic sites** - for example if you delete item in portfolio, every chart and Card with items data will be recalculated and updated in real time
- **Consistent, responsive design** - which was especially difficult due to many charts and cards with text of different lenght
- Using **Skeletons** for improved loading experience
- **Prefetching** of crucial images
- And more

## How to run

You have to have python,pip and npm installed to run this project.

Do it in cmd instead of powershell.

**Backend server**:

- `cd backend`

- Create virtual enviroment: `python -m venv venv`

- Activate virtual enviroment: `".\venv\scripts\activate"`  
(if it's not activating try using cmd instead of powershell)

- If (venv) is present before your directory in terminal, install required packages:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

- ~~Migrate django db if needed:
`python manage.py migrate`~~

- Run Django server:
`python manage.py runserver`

- Server should run on http://127.0.0.1:8000/

**Frontend server** (in other console):

- `cd frontend/`

- Install required packages: `npm install`

- Create build: `npm run build` (should take around 2 minutes)

- Start app: `npm run start`

- If doesn't work for some reason run in developement mode\*: `npm run dev`

- Server should run at http://localhost:3000

- You can login using example account `login: admin` `password: admin`

\*-Development is faster to run but switching between sites might take longed due to jit compiling. If you click through routes and wait for 10-20s it should be faster

## Other info

This project is not perfect and my TODO list is still quite huge. There was many things that I did for a first time or testing if they are beneficial to my work and project management, so there are some not polished files of course. But overall I'm satisfied with the results and how efficient I was while implementing it.
